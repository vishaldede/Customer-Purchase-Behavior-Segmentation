# üõçÔ∏è Customer Purchase Behavior Segmentation (Unsupervised Clustering)

> A complete end-to-end **Machine Learning Project** for identifying customer segments using **unsupervised clustering** techniques.

---

## üìä Project Overview

In today‚Äôs competitive market, understanding customer behavior is crucial for personalized marketing and retention.  
This project uses **unsupervised machine learning** to analyze and segment customers based on their **purchase patterns, income, spending score, and frequency**.

We apply multiple clustering algorithms to create meaningful customer groups and help businesses tailor their strategies for each segment.

---

## üß† Objectives

- Understand customer purchase behavior using **EDA & visualization**
- Segment customers using **K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, and GMM**
- Evaluate clustering performance using **Silhouette Score**
- Store and query data using **MySQL**
- Generate actionable business insights for marketing teams

## üß© Project Workflow

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset**
- **10,000 customer records**
- 4 true customer groups:
  - **Budget Shoppers**
  - **Regular Buyers**
  - **Premium Loyalists**
  - **Young Impulsives**
- Added **dirty and inconsistent data** for realism:
  - Missing values  
  - Typos & inconsistent formatting  
  - Outliers  
  - Duplicate records  
  - Wrong data types & date formats  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning**
- Standardized categorical values (e.g. ‚Äúfemail‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúFemale‚Äù)
- Fixed wrong data types and date formats  
- Removed duplicates and outliers using IQR  
- Filled missing values with median/mode  
- Saved as: `customer_purchase_behavior_cleaned.csv`

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis**

### **MySQL Integration**
- Stored cleaned dataset in MySQL using `mysql-connector-python`
- Performed 7 SQL analytical queries:
  - Total customers by country  
  - Average income & spending by loyalty status  
  - Top 5 high spenders  
  - Preferred category distribution  
  - Signup trends by month
    
---

### **EDA with Matplotlib and Seaborn**
- Gender and Age Distribution  
- Income vs Spending Score Relationship  
- Loyalty Status vs Purchase Frequency  
- Most Preferred Product Categories  
- Correlation Heatmap of behavioral features  

**Tools:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing & Modeling**
- Scaled numerical features with `StandardScaler`
- Applied multiple clustering algorithms:
  - **K-Means**
  - **DBSCAN**
  - **Agglomerative Clustering**
  - **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation**
| Algorithm | Best Params | Silhouette Score | Comment |
|------------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| KMeans | k=4 | **0.61** | Best performance |
| Agglomerative | k=4 | 0.57 | Good alternative |
| GMM | k=4 | 0.54 | Moderate overlap |
| DBSCAN | eps=0.5 | 0.18 | Poor separation |

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Business Insights**
| Segment | Description | Behavior |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Budget Shoppers** | Low income, low spending, few purchases | Prefer groceries |
| **Regular Buyers** | Mid income, moderate spending | Loyal, prefer clothing |
| **Premium Loyalists** | High income, high spending, frequent purchases | Prefer electronics & beauty |
| **Young Impulsives** | Young, mid-income, high spending | Prefer sports & fashion |

---

## üìà Results Visualization

| Visualization | Insight |
|----------------|----------|
| Income vs Spending Score | Shows natural separation between segments |
| Loyalty vs Frequency | Higher loyalty ‚Üí higher purchase frequency |
| PCA 2D Cluster Plot | 4 well-defined clusters |


---

## üßÆ Evaluation Metric: Silhouette Score

| Range | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| 0.5 ‚Äì 1.0 | Excellent clustering |
| 0.2 ‚Äì 0.5 | Moderate clustering |
| < 0.2 | Poor clustering |
